      <p>Firstly I would like to apologize for this speech, but I am using a backup that was prepared at the last minute. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts and the general infeasibility of my first idea, I’ve been forced to make do with a lesser substitute.</p>
      <p>In my original plan, the Chapel wouldn’t be here right now. Poof, it would have vanished without a trace. In my ideal it would be spring term, so there would be smooth grass set up with folding chairs and a podium. Some enterprising faculty members would take charge and funnel everyone to their seats in the first open air chapel, and I would deliver substantially the same speech. You can imagine my displeasure when I was told that there was no budget for such a dramatic stunt, and Mr. Cohen is too busy at Law School, so I guess that we will just have to get by with our imagination.</p>
      <p>But why make the chapel disappear? I didn’t just want to get out of making this talk. For some reason I feel a compulsion to take advantage of times when I have a large captive audience. I still can’t figure out whether it is because I am a Narcissist or a Masochist, but I’m up here sweating under my own free will. Instead I would want to point out how strange it is to be having chapel without the chapel. The content, a reading, a hymn, a talk, reports, could be normal, but without the right building we would be lost. Even when we meet in the morning in Mem Hall, the service can’t really be called chapel, which is why we call it mem-hall chapel. Chapel’s just not the same thing without the building. The service is irrevocably tied to the place.</p>
